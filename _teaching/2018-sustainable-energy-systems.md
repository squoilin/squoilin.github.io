Course information
==================
Title: Sustainable Energy Systems
Code: B-KUL-ZA0039

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
===================
The student can define the concept of sustainability and apply it to energy supply in our society. He has knowledge of the state of the art and new developments in technology, costs, regulations and incentive policies regarding sustainable energy systems and can reason about them in a nuanced way (MK1, MG3).
The student has technological knowledge of solar energy systems (thermal and electrical), wind energy systems, hydropower, heat pumps, energy storage technology and hydrogen technology (MK1).
The student can make simple calculations regarding the dimensioning of renewable energy systems (both at component and system level) and interpret the results (MK1, MI1, MG3).
The student can make a basic design of an energy system with sustainable components and perform basic calculations for the dimensioning of this system, which are necessary to prepare a good design (MK1, MI1, MI2).
The student can work accurately when performing design and sizing calculations (MG5).

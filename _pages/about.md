I am an FNRS Research Associate (Chercheur Qualifié) and professor at the [University of Liège](http://www.uliege.be), head of the [Integrated and Sustainable Energy Systems (ISES) Research group](https://www.ises.uliege.be/)

I conduct research in the field of Integrated Energy Systems, mainly focused on the transition towards clean and renewable energy production. In the course of my work I created and lead development of various open-source modelling tools, such as ThermoCycle, Dispa-SET or ProsumPy. These activities are further detailed hereunder.


Research topics
------
Energy planning:
* Energy sufficiency
* Heat integration into energy systems and deployment of renewables
* Integrated energy systems & sector coupling

International development:
* Rural electrification pathways and microgrids
* Tailored models for energy planning in developing countries


Teaching
------
At KU Leuven:
* Sustainable energy systems
* [Energy systems design and simulation](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/n/ZA0042N.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp13939632)

At the University of Liège:
* [Introduction to the dynamic modeling of thermal systems](https://www.programmes.uliege.be/archives/20132014/cocoon/en/cours/MECA0514-1.html)

Open-Source Projects
------
* [Dispa-SET](http://www.dispaset.eu/): Power market model including unit commitment and optimal dispatch

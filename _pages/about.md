I am an FNRS Research Associate (Chercheur Qualifié) and professor at the [University of Liège](http://www.uliege.be), head of the [Integrated and Sustainable Energy Systems (ISES) Research group](https://www.ises.uliege.be/)

I conduct research in the field of Integrated Energy Systems, mainly focused on the transition towards clean and renewable energy production. In the course of my work I created and lead development of various open-source modelling tools, such as MicrogrdsPy, Dispa-SET or ProsumPy. These activities are further detailed hereunder.


Research topics
------
Energy planning:
* Energy sufficiency
* Heat integration into energy systems and deployment of renewables
* Integrated energy systems & sector coupling

International development:
* Energy transition in developing countries
* Rural electrification pathways and microgrids


Open-Source Projects
------
* [RAMP](https://rampdemand.org/): Software suite for the stochastic simulation of user-driven energy demand time series
* [Dispa-SET](http://www.dispaset.eu/): Power market model including unit commitment and optimal dispatch
* [GPExp](https://github.com/squoilin/GPExp): A Gaussian Processes framework for the analysis of Experimental Data
* [ThermoCycle](http://www.thermocycle.net/): A Modelica Library for the dynamic modelling of thermal systems
* [CoolProp](http://coolprop.sourceforge.net/index.html): An open-source, cross-platform, free property database based in C++ that includes pure fluids, pseudo-pure fluids, and humid air properties.

Sylvain Quoilin is a professor in the field of Energy Systems and leads the ISES research group at the University of Liège. His research focuses on modeling the energy transition, including the integration of renewables, heating and cooling systems, and vehicles into energy grids. He also conducts interdisciplinary research on energy sufficiency, both in the EU and in developing countries, by incorporating human behavior into demand modeling.

He has acquired substantial international experience through positions at leading institutions, including MIT, TU München, KU Leuven, and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.

He is the author and co-author of more than 150 publications in conference proceeding and journals. He leads the development of various open-source energy modelling tools and he is an active member of organizations promoting open-science practices in scientific research.
